This is my project for Code Louisville May 2017 FEWD.

I chose to do a redesign of an existing website - my cousin's e-commerce site. The original website can be viewed at the following link: http://www.modernroots.org/store/c1/Featured_Products.html.

I wanted to give her online presence a fresher, more appealing look and feel, as her products are great, but her website is not so great!
